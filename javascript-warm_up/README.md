JavaScript is a popular programming language commonly used for web development.
JavaScript is a versatile, high-level scripting language that runs in web browsers. 
It adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
 With JavaScript, you can manipulate webpage content, respond to user actions (like clicks and input), and communicate with web servers to fetch or send data without
 requiring a page reload. JavaScript code is typically embedded directly into HTML documents or included as separate files. 
It's known for its flexibility and is essential for creating modern, interactive web applications. 
Beginners often start with basic concepts like variables, functions, and conditional statements before progressing to more advanced topics like 
object-oriented programming and working with libraries and frameworks.
