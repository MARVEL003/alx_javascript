An empty class definition like Rectangle doesn't provide any functionality or data by default, but it serves as a blueprint for creating objects that are meant to 
represent rectangles in JavaScript. You should know these:

1) Basic Structure: An empty class definition is often used as a starting point when you want to define a more complex class later.
 It follows the basic class syntax in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6).

2) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The class Rectangle is an example of an object-oriented programming (OOP) concept.
 In OOP, classes serve as templates for creating objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

3) Properties and Methods: While the Rectangle class is empty, you can add properties (e.g., width and height) and methods (e.g., calculate area or perimeter) to it 
later to define the characteristics and behaviors of rectangles.

4)Instantiation: You can create instances of the Rectangle class using the new keyword.

5) Inheritance: You can extend the Rectangle class to create more specialized subclasses with additional properties and methods.
 For instance, you might create a Square subclass that inherits from Rectangle but enforces that width and height are always equal.

6)Code Organization: Defining an empty class allows you to structure your code in a way that separates concerns.
 You can start with the class definition and then progressively add attributes and methods as your project requirements evolve.

7) Code Readability: Using classes makes your code more readable and maintainable, especially when working on larger projects.
 It helps encapsulate related data and behaviors within a single unit.

8) Documentation: Even if the class is empty at first, it can serve as a form of documentation, indicating the intent that rectangles will be modeled in your program.
